## By: Wesley Blake Jr

This app allows the user to add a train to the schedule. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

The app incorporates Firebase to host the arrival and departure data. It will retrieve 
and manipulate this information with Moment.js.
